Notes: my code works little bit differently than your requirements. For example for input 4, my code calculates 7 possiblities.
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 2]
[2, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 2]
[1, 3]
[3, 1]

Write a function that returns the number of ways a person can climb n stairs, where the person may only climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
To illustrate, if n = 4 there are 5 ways to climb:
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 1, 2]
[2, 2]
